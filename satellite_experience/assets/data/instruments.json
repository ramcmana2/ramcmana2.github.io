Measuring these emissions will identify the composition of the asteroid without direct sampling.", "img": "../assets/images/spectrometers.png"},

The dish shaped antenna is aimed precisely at earth and transmits images and telemetry using X-Band frequency across the vastness of space.", "img": "../assets/images/antenna.png"},
    {"name": "imager", "title": "Multispectral Imager", "description": "Provides high-resolution images using filters to discriminate between Psycheâ€™s metallic and silicate constituents. The instrument consists of a pair of identical cameras designed to acquire geologic, compositional, and topographic data.", "img": "../assets/images/instruments/multispectral-imager.jpg"},
    {"name": "communication", "title": "Deep Space Optical Communication", "description": "A sophisticated new laser communication technology that encodes data in photons (rather than radio waves) to communicate between a probe in deep space and Earth. Using light instead of radio allows the spacecraft to communicate more data in a given amount of time.", "img": "../assets/images/instruments/psyche-dsoc.jpg"},
